**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This is extremely beta right now, and you're watching us
develop and improve it. The code is open source so you can start trying it out
now, but please be careful before using this in production. If you don't know
how to debug it, please hold off using it yet.

## What?

Export Humans lets you export profile field data from BuddyPress, either for
on-screen display, or as CSV, for manipulation elsewhere.

## Why?

As BuddyPress powers communities large and small, certain types of site require
member profile data to be viewed across multiple users, rather than one member
at a time. In other words, wide and thin, instead of narrow and deep.

## How?

Export Humans is pretty simple to use. It adds a new "Profile Reports" menu item under "Users" inside the WordPress wp-admin area.

### WordPress Plugin

Clone or submodule this repository into your `plugins` directory, and load it
on your BuddyPress site.

## Who?

Created by Human Made for BuddyPress.
